                        Recording artists who turn actors–hm,
                        slashies are few and far between in Tinseltown
                        but I’ll guess that Disney actress Sabrina Carpenter
                        has enough brawn and savvy (to say nothing of her
                        sparkling gaze and outgoing personality) to
                        convince any potential naysayers that she can do both extremely well.
                        Carpenter landed her first acting role in 2010 in the NBC drama series
                        LAW & ORDER: SVU. She played a young victim interviewed by Detective
                        Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni). Randomly, she performed live on
                        the Chinese television station Hunan Broadcasting System, for the Gold
                        Mango Audience festival in the same period. In a nod to Christina Aguilera
                        Carpenter performed “Something’s Got a Hold on Me” from a 1963 Etta James LP.
